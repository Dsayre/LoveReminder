**Proposal**
-----------------------

Dating can be tricky, especially when you are trying to figure out if someone is the right match. Even the great Shakespeare once said, “Love is a smoke and is made with the fume of sighs”. But things have changed, technology can send people into outer space, it can also make it easier for people to find love. Technology did help us, it gave us Tinder, eHarmony and etc. Since then people no longer need to go to places to find their better half, instead, they sit at home busy swiping left or right. One might ask where is the action; where is the passion; where is the thrill of meeting new people and wondering if he or she is the Mr. or Ms. Right? There is none.


Nowadays, online dating experience is highly static since people need to browse through the dating websites for others’ detailed profile in order to find an interesting one. Moreover, time spent on searching and matching on those websites is dramatically waste from time to time. What if someone comes across their crush face to face and is afraid to ask for numbers? What if someone is attractive in terms of appearance but actually is not a match of characteristic at all? What if someone knows that other half decreed by fate is somewhere in the crowd nearby? Obviously they need to know the exact location. LoveReminder is here for solving these problems.


We propose building an Android application -- LoveReminder, as the solution for this problem. Add action and mystery back into dating. Our solution takes advantage of Google Beacon Platform and Nearby API technology, the first one provides us a strong context signal in the form of Bluetooth low energy(BLE) beacons and the latter gives us the option to detect those beacons in a certain range. With the help of these two IoT technologies, we are able to create a more mobile environment while keeping all the simplicity that other existing dating agent provides.


Love should come when you are least expecting. We will add that exciting element into our application. You might be get matched, when you are getting your first Starbucks coffee of the day or when you are in the library studying for the final. That is something that other dating application out there cannot provide.
